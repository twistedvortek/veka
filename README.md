# Sayara: Advanced Driver Assistance and Fleet Management System

## Introduction

Sayara is an innovative project aimed at revolutionizing road safety and fleet management through the integration of cutting-edge object detection and tracking technologies. Utilizing the powerful YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSORT for object tracking, Sayara provides real-time insights into vehicle and driver behavior, promoting safer driving practices and optimizing fleet operations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Leverages YOLOv8 to detect vehicles, pedestrians, and other objects in real-time, enhancing situational awareness for drivers.
- **Advanced Object Tracking**: Incorporates DeepSORT algorithm for seamless tracking of objects across video frames, enabling accurate monitoring of dynamic environments.
- **Driver Behavior Analysis**: Analyzes driving patterns to identify risky behaviors, offering feedback for improvement.
- **Fleet Management Dashboard**: Offers a comprehensive dashboard for fleet operators to monitor vehicle locations, track driver performance, and analyze trip data.
- **Incident Alerts**: Automatically detects potential hazards and notifies drivers and fleet managers, facilitating proactive risk management.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8**: For state-of-the-art object detection, providing high accuracy and speed.
- **DeepSORT**: For robust object tracking, maintaining object identities even in challenging scenarios.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the backend and integration logic.
- **Flask**: For creating a responsive and scalable web application backend.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For crafting an intuitive and dynamic frontend user experience.

## System Architecture

Sayara's architecture is designed for scalability and performance, consisting of:

- **Frontend Application**: Showcases the real-time video feed, object detection and tracking outputs, and analytical insights through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Backend Services**: Handles video processing, object detection and tracking, data analysis, and serves as the bridge between the frontend and the core algorithms.
- **Data Storage**: Securely stores video feeds, detection and tracking data, and analytics for historical analysis and reporting.
